	// the plan
	// set an arr to the desired key combo
	// detect user keypress (or up or down?)
	// if user keypress matches, store it to its own arr

	// don't want to store keys not part of secret keycombo, right?
	// only push user keys to array of user keys if they match magic key array

	//maybe use and compare objects instead of arrays? which is better?

	// when arrays/objects match, do the secret magic thing
