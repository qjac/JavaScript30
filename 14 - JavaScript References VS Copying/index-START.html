    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //100 100

    let name = 'wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); //wes wes
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); //Wesley wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); //if you slice and pass no args, it returns a copy of the original array
    team2[2] = 'Jimbo';
    console.log(team2, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Jimbo';
    console.log(team3, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //takes all items fromt he iterable and spread it into the new array
    console.log(team4, players);

    team4[0] = 'Jimbo';
    console.log(team4, players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5, players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);
    // no copy! it updates the original!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

       const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
